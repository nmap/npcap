<h3>Packet Dump</h3>
<p>This program reads packets from a file or a network adapter, depending on
a command line switch. If a source is not provided, the program shows a list of
available adapters, one of which can be selected. Once the
capture is started, the program prints the timestamp, the length and the raw
contents of the packets. Once compiled, it will run on all the Win32 platforms. It
can be compiled to run on Unix as well (the makefile is provided).</p>
