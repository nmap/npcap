<h3>Packet Filter</h3>

<p>This is a more complete example of libpcap usage. It shows, among other
things, how to create and set filters and how to save a capture to disk. It can
be compiled under Win32 or Unix (projects and makefiles are provided).
Pcap_filter (pf.exe) is a general-purpose packet filtering application: its
input parameters are a source of packets (it can be a physical interface or a
file), a filter and an output file. It takes packets from the source until
CTRL+C is pressed or the whole file is processed, applies the filter to the
incoming packets and saves them to the output file if they satisfy the filter.
Pcap_filter can be used to dump network data according to a particular filter,
but also to extract a set of packets from a previously saved file. The format of
both input and output files is the format used by libpcap, i.e. same of WinDump, tcpdump
and many other network tools.</p>
