    <title>Using the Npcap SDK</title>

    <para>
      To build software that uses Npcap, use the latest version of the Npcap Software Development Kit (SDK).
      The latest SDK can be downloaded on <ulink role="hidepdf" url="http://npcap.org/#download">Npcap.org</ulink>.
      Updates to the SDK are much less frequent than updates to the Npcap binaries.

    <title>Updating WinPcap software to Npcap</title>
    <para>
      For the most part, Npcap is completely compatible with software written
      for WinPcap. Minor changes need to be made to <xref
        linkend="npcap-feature-native-dll">DLL loading order</xref> and in some
      cases <xref linkend="npcap-feature-native-servicename">driver service
        name</xref>. However, there have been many improvements to the libpcap
      API between the last release of WinPcap and the current release of Npcap.
      Reviewing the changes may help improve performance, reliability, and
      maintainability of software that uses Npcap.
    </para>

    <para>Apart from the libpcap API, WinPcap exported a few functions used by
      <ulink url="https://www.winpcap.org/windump/">WinDump</ulink> that were
      related to porting a Unix-style tool to Windows but unrelated to packet
      capture. Those functions were not documented in the WinPcap
      documentation, have never been included in libpcap, and are therefore not
      in the Npcap API: <code>getservent</code>, <code>endservent</code>, and
      <code>eproto_db</code>.</para>

    <para>One other function exported by WinPcap, <code>wsockinit</code>, is
      available via the Npcap API as <code>pcap_wsockinit</code>. It calls
      <code>WSAStartup</code> for Windows Sockets version 1.1 and ensures that
      <code>WSACleanup</code> is called when the process ends.</para>

    <title>How to detect what version Npcap/WinPcap you are using?</title>

    <para>
      Sometimes, our user software needs to detect the existence of Npcap/WinPcap
      at install-time or run-time. Although Npcap's GUI installer has the ability
      to handle this, you may want to handle it by yourself in some conditions,
      like you run Npcap installer in silent-mode.  The run-time detection is even
      more useful. Your software probably has some functions that rely on Npcap's
      particular features (like loopback capture). You need to know if you
      are running on top of Npcap or the legacy WinPcap to control whether to
      switch your functions on.  Fortunately, Npcap provides you some methods to
      detect Npcap/WinPcap at install-time and run-time.
    </para>

    <sect3 id="npcap-detect-version">
      <title>Npcap version</title>

      <para> Npcap has a version number that is independent of WinPcap. The last
        release of WinPcap was version 4.1.3, but Npcap started over counting
        versions from 0.00. In order to make it clear to the installers and other
        software that Npcap is newer and more advanced, the executable
        <quote>file version</quote> was advanced to <quote>5.0.0.000</quote> at
        that point. The major version will always be <quote>5</quote> to
        distinguish Npcap from WinPcap. The minor version is Npcap's major
        version; the revision is Npcap's minor version; and the build number is
        an encoding of the build date. So a file version of
        <quote>5.0.92.612</quote> is Npcap 0.92, built on June 12th.</para>

        You can check the existence of <filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\NPFInstall.exe</filename> to

        Npcap and WinPcap can be installed together on a system. Which capture
        library is used by the user software relies on the DLL loading path. If
        Npcap's <filename>wpcap.dll</filename> is loaded first, then you are using
        Npcap, vice versa. However, it's difficult and fragile to check the DLL
        loading path by yourself.  Fortunately, you can use
        <function>pcap_lib_version</function> to get the Npcap/WinPcap version
        string.

        in both modes, a good practice is just trying the <varname>npcap</varname> service first.
        If it fails, then try the <varname>npf</varname> service. This is also what most of our users
        do in their software based on our investigation. A code sample from Nmap is
