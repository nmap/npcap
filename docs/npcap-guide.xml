  packet data stucture has changed (from <varname>NDIS_PACKET</varname> to <varname>NET_BUFFER_LIST</varname>)
  since Vista and NDIS 5 needs to handle extra packet structure conversion.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Latest libpcap API Support</emphasis>: Npcap provides support
  for the latest <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap">libpcap API</ulink>
  by accepting libpcap as a <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">Git submodule</ulink>.
  The latest libpcap 1.8.0 has integrated more fascinating features and functions than the
  <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://www.winpcap.org/misc/changelog.htm">deprecated libpcap 1.0.0 shipped by WinPcap</ulink>.
  Moreover, since Linux already has a good support for latest libpcap API, using
  Npcap on Windows facilitates your software to base on the same API on both Windows and Linux.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis><quote>Admin-only Mode</quote> Support</emphasis>: Npcap supports to restrict its
  use to Administrators for safety purpose. If Npcap is installed with
  the option <quote>Restrict Npcap driver's access to Administrators only</quote> checked,
  when a non-Admin user tries to start a user software (Nmap, Wireshark, etc),
  the <ulink role="hidepdf" url="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-is-user-account-control#1TC=windows-7">User Account Control (UAC)</ulink>
  dialog will prompt asking for Administrator privilege. Only when the end
  user chooses Yes, the driver can be accessed. This is similar to UNIX
  where you need root access to capture packets.</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis><quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote>
  Support</emphasis>: <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote> is used to decide whether Npcap should coexist With WinPcap or
  be compatible with WinPcap. With <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote> OFF, Npcap
  can coexist with WinPcap and share the DLL binary interface with WinPcap.
  So the applications unaware of Npcap <emphasis>SHOULD</emphasis> be able to use Npcap
  automatically if WinPcap is unavailable. The applications who knows
  Npcap's existence can choose to use Npcap or WinPcap first. The key
  about which is loaded first is DLL Search Path. With <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote> OFF, Npcap installs its DLLs into <filename>C:\Windows\System32\Npcap\</filename>
  instead of WinPcap's <filename>C:\Windows\System32\</filename>. So applications who want
  to load Npcap first must make <filename>C:\Windows\System32\Npcap\</filename> precedent
  to other paths in ways such as calling <function>SetDllDirectory</function>, etc. Another
  point is Npcap uses service name <quote>npcap</quote> instead of WinPcap's <quote>npf</quote> with
  <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote> OFF. So applications using <command>net start npf</command>
  for starting service must use <command>net start npcap</command> instead. If you want
  100% compatibility with WinPcap, you should install Npcap choosing
  <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote> (<quote>Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode</quote>).
  In this mode, Npcap will install its Dlls in WinPcap's <filename>C:\Windows\System32\</filename>
  and use the <quote>npf</quote> service name. It's notable that before installing in
  this mode, you must uninstall WinPcap first (the installer wizard will
  prompt you that).</para></listitem>

  <listitem><para><emphasis>Loopback Packets Capture Support</emphasis>: Now Npcap is able to

  technique. After installation, Npcap will create an adapter named <quote>Npcap
  Loopback Adapter</quote> for you. If you are a Wireshark user, choose this adapter
  to capture, you will see all loopback traffic the same way as other
  non-loopback adapters. Try it by typing in commands like <command>ping 127.0.0.1</command>

<sect1 id="npcap-detect">
  <title>How to detect what version Npcap/WinPcap you are using?</title>
  
  <para>
  Sometimes, our user software needs to detect the existence of Npcap/WinPcap at install-time or run-time. Although Npcap's GUI installer has the ability to handle this, you may want to handle it by yourself in some conditions, like you run Npcap installer in silent-mode.
  The run-time detection is even more useful. Your software probably has some functions that rely on Npcap's particular features (like the loopback interface). You need to know if you are running on top of Npcap or the legacy WinPcap to control whether to switch your functions on.
  Fortunately, Npcap provides you some methods to detect Npcap/WinPcap at install-time and run-time.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="npcap-detect-version">
    <title>Npcap version</title>

    <para>
    You may notice that Npcap has several version strings. The installer name can be something
	like <filename>npcap-0.07-r5.exe</filename>. <quote>0.07</quote> is the version number, and
	<quote>r5</quote> is the revision number. We use a version number less than <quote>1.00</quote>
	to imply that it's still a beta release. This naming follows the Nmap's convension. However,
	WinPcap follows a different version system. It has three dotted figures like <quote>4.1.3</quote>,
	which is more Wireshark-like. One thing you need to know here is that Npcap starts the
	development based on the latest WinPcap <quote>4.1.3</quote>. So any Npcap release is more
	<emphasis>advanced</emphasis> than WinPcap's latest release. Another thing needs to notice is
	that, the <quote>0.07</quote> version number can be obtained from the
	<function>pcap_lib_version</function> function. The <quote>r5</quote> revision number
	<emphasis>only</emphasis> appears in the installer filename, it doesn't show its existence
	in any code or functions. So you'd better not determine anything based on Npcap revision
	number. Just use the latest release.
    </para>

    <para>
    The executable file version (aka e-version in this document) is another thing we need to notice.
	A e-version has four dotted figures on Windows. Npcap's e-version is something like
	<quote>5.0.7.424</quote>. <quote>5</quote> here is used to advance Npcap version than the legacy
	WinPcap's e-version <quote>4.1.0.2980</quote> because <quote>5.0.7.424</quote> is larger than
	<quote>4.1.0.2980</quote>. The legacy WinPcap installer and Wireshark uses e-version to check
	the version of WinPcap. Usually these legacy codes don't even know Npcap. So Npcap needs to
	make them simply think Npcap is a newer version of WinPcap. <quote>0</quote> and <quote>7</quote>
	in Npcap's e-version corresponds to Npcap's version <quote>0.07</quote>. <quote>424</quote> means
	that this release is built at date <quote>4.24</quote> (aka 24th, April). When Npcap version jumps
	to a new version (like from <quote>0.06</quote> to <quote>0.07</quote>), the e-version will also
	change (like from <quote>0.6.0.301</quote> to <quote>0.7.0.424</quote>). A revision update won't
	cause a change of version or e-version.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="npcap-detect-install-time">
    <title>Install-time detection</title>

    <para>
    You can check the existence of <filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\NPFInstall.exe</filename> to
	detect Npcap's existence. If Npcap exists, you can check the file version of
	<filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\NPFInstall.exe</filename> to detect Npcap e-version. The
	e-version also gives you the version. The NSIS code is shown below. <varname>$inst_ver</varname>
	is an e-version string like <quote>5.0.7.424</quote>

    <para>
    You can check the installation options of an already installed Npcap by reading the registry
	key: <filename>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\npf</filename>
	(WinPcap compatible mode) or <filename>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\npcap</filename>

	<filename>Loopback</filename>, <filename>DltNull</filename>,<filename>Dot11Support</filename>,
	<filename>VlanSupport</filename>, <filename>WinPcapCompatible</filename>, etc. show the installation options.
	<filename>Loopback</filename> is <code>REG_SZ</code> type. A non-NULL value indicates the option is
	<emphasis>CHECKED</emphasis>. All other entries are <code>REG_DWORD</code> type. A 0x00000001 value
	indicates the option is <emphasis>CHECKED</emphasis>.
    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="npcap-detect-run-time">
    <title>Run-time detection</title>

    <para>
    Npcap and WinPcap can be installed together on a symtem. Which capture library is used by the
	user software relies on the DLL loading path. If Npcap's <filename>wpcap.dll</filename> is loaded first, then you
	are using Npcap, vice versa. However, it's difficult and fragile to check the DLL loading path by yourself.
  Fortunately, you can use <function>pcap_lib_version</function> to get the Npcap/WinPcap version string.
  </para>

<screen>
char *pcap_version = pcap_lib_version();
printf("%s", pcap_version);
// Npcap output: "Npcap version 0.08, based on libpcap version 1.8.0"
// WinPcap output: "WinPcap version 4.1.3"
</screen>

	<para>Considering Npcap has different driver service names for different modes, we provide a
  way to get the current service name. You can query the registry key:
  <filename>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Npcap\WinPcapCompatible</filename> for x64
  systems (or <filename>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Npcap\WinPcapCompatible</filename> for x86
  systems). If it's 1, it means Npcap is installed in <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote>. In this mode both
  <varname>npcap</varname> and <varname>npf</varname> services (drivers) are installed. If
  the key value is 0, it means Npcap is installed in <quote>Non-WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote>.
  In this mode only <varname>npcap</varname> service (driver) is installed. We
  <emphasis>recommend</emphasis> our users to use the <varname>npcap</varname> service instead
  of <varname>npf</varname>. Given that <varname>npcap</varname> service is always installed
  in both modes, a good practice is just trying the <varname>npcap</varname> service first.
  If it fails, then try the <varname>npf</varname> service. This is also what most of our users
  do in their software based on our investigation. A code sample from Nmap is

  <title>For software that use Npcap loopback feature</title>

  <para>
  Prerequisite: Check the <option>Support loopback traffic ("Npcap Loopback Adapter" will be created)</option> option at install-time.
  </para>

  <para>
  Npcap's loopback adapter device is based on <quote>Microsoft KM-TEST Loopback Adapter</quote>
  (Win8 and Win10) or <quote>Microsoft Loopback Adapter</quote> (Vista, Win7). It is an Ethernet
  adapter, and Npcap has changed its behavior and rename it to <quote>Npcap Loopback Adapter</quote>,
  to make it see the real loopback traffic only. The traffic captured by original WinPcap will not appear here.
  </para>

  <para>
  The IP address of <quote>Npcap Loopback Adapter</quote> is usually like 169.254.x.x. However,
  this IP is totally meaningless. Software using Npcap should regard this interface's IP address
  as 127.0.0.1 (IPv4) and ::1 (IPv6). This work can't be done by Npcap because Windows forbids
  any IP address to be configured as 127.0.0.1 or ::1 as they're reserved.
  </para>

  <para>
  The MAC address of <quote>Npcap Loopback Adapter</quote> is usually like 02:00:4C:4F:4F:50. However,
  this address is meaningless too. Software using Npcap should think this interface doesn't own a
  MAC address, as the loopback traffic never goes to link layer. For software using Npcap to
  capture loopback traffic, the MAC addresses in captured data will be all zeros (aka 00:00:00:00:00:00).
  For software using Npcap to send loopback traffic, any MAC addresses can be specified as they
  will be ignored. But notice that ether_type in Ethernet header should be set correctly. Only <option>IPv4</option>
  and <option>IPv6</option> are accepted. Other values like <option>ARP</option> will be ignored. (You don't need an ARP request for
  loopback interface)
  </para>

  <para>
  The MTU of <quote>Npcap Loopback Adapter</quote> is hard-coded to 65536 by Npcap. Software
  using Npcap should get this value automatically and no special handling is needed. This value is
  determined personally by me and doesn't mean Windows loopback stack can only support packet size
  as large as 65536. So don't feel weird if you have captured packets whose size are larger than it.
  </para>

  <para>
  Don't try to make OID requests to <quote>Npcap Loopback Adapter</quote> except
  <varname>OID_GEN_MAXIMUM_TOTAL_SIZE</varname> (MTU). Those requests will still succeed like
  other adapters do, but they only make sense for NDIS adapters and Npcap doesn't even use the
  NDIS way to handle the loopback traffic. The only handled OID request by Npcap is
  <varname>OID_GEN_MAXIMUM_TOTAL_SIZE</varname>. If you query its value, you will always get
  65550 (65536 + 14). If you try to set its value, the operation will always fail.

    <title>How to use Wireshark to capture raw 802.11 traffic in <quote>Monitor Mode</quote></title>

    <para>
    The latest Wireshark has already integrated the support for Npcap's <quote>Monitor Mode</quote> capture.
	If you want to use Wireshark to capture raw 802.11 traffic in <quote>Monitor Mode</quote>, you need to
	<emphasis>switch on the monitor mode inside the Wireshark UI instead of using WlanHelper</emphasis>.
	This is because Wireshark only recognizes the monitor mode set by itself. So when you turn
	on monitor mode outside Wireshark (like in <filename>WlanHelper</filename>), Wireshark will not know the adapter
	has been in monitor mode, and will still try to capture in Ethernet mode, which will get no traffic.
	So after all, the correct steps are:

  consider that you have <emphasis>installed some incompatible software</emphasis>.
  It can be a <emphasis>VPN, anti-virus, firewall or other network related</emphasis>
  software. We are maintaining an incompatible software list in the previous section.
  So you can uninstall all those potential software one by one, and see which one

    <title>Diagnostic report</title>

    <para>
    Npcap has provided a diagnostic utility called <filename>DiagReport</filename>.
	It provides a lot of information including OS metadata, Npcap related files,
	install options, registry values, services, etc. You can simply click the
	<filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\DiagReport.bat</filename> file to run <filename>DiagReport</filename>.
	It will pop up a text report via Notepad (it's stored in: <filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\DiagReport.txt</filename>).
	Please always submit it to us if you encounter any issues.
    </para>

    <para>
    For Vista users: <filename>DiagReport</filename> is a script written by
	<ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/mt173057.aspx">Windows PowerShell</ulink>,
	and Vista doesn't have it installed by default. So if you are using Vista,
	you need to install <emphasis>PowerShell 2.0 (KB968930)</emphasis> on your
	system. Please download it <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://www.microsoft.com/en-hk/download/details.aspx?id=9864">here for x86</ulink>
	and <ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=9239">here for x64</ulink>.
	Win7 and later systems have built-in PowerShell support and don't need

    <title>Dynamic link library (DLL) log</title>

    <para>
    If you think the dynamic link library (<filename>Packet.dll</filename>) doesn't
	function well, you can refer to <filename>Packet.dll</filename>'s log. It's
	also stored in Npcap's installation folder: <filename>C:\Program Files\Npcap\Packet.log</filename>.
	We don't enable this log feature in regular releases. You have two ways: If you
	are a Npcap developer, you can build the <filename>Packet.sln</filename> project
	with the <varname>_DEBUG_TO_FILE</varname> macro defined. If you are only a
	Npcap user, you can download the packet-debug version Npcap from our releases.
	Currently, the latest packet-debug version is
	<ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://github.com/nmap/npcap/releases/tag/v0.08-r4">Npcap 0.08 r4</ulink>.
	You can also ask me to build a packet-debug version Npcap for a specific version Npcap.
	I'll be glad to do it. Note, the (<filename>Packet.log</filename>) file is written
	in an appending manner. So you may want to delete it after an amount of time, or
	save your output to another place before it gets too large.

  <sect2 id="npcap-issues-driver-log">
    <title>Driver log</title>

    <para>
    If you think the driver doesn't function well, you can open an
	<emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> command prompt,  enter
	<command>sc query npcap</command> to query the driver status and
	<command>net start npcap</command> to start the driver (replace
	<replaceable>npcap</replaceable> with <replaceable>npf</replaceable>
	if you installed Npcap in <quote>WinPcap Compatible Mode</quote>).
	The command output will inform you whether there's an error. If
	the driver is running well, but the issue still exists, then you
	need to check the driver's log. Normal Npcap releases don't switch
	on the driver log function for performance. So you have to install
	a driver-debug version Npcap. We don't build a driver-debug version for every
	release. Currently, the latest driver-debug version is
	<ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://github.com/nmap/npcap/releases/tag/v0.08-r7">Npcap 0.08 r7</ulink>.
	If the currently available driver-debug version Npcap doesn't have your
	issue, you can ask me to build a driver-debug version Npcap for a specific
	version in mail. I'll be happy to do that. When you have got an
	appropriate driver-debug version Npcap, you need to use
	<ulink role="hidepdf" url="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/debugview.aspx">DbgView</ulink>
	to read the Windows kernel log (which contains our driver log).
	You may need to turn on DbgView before installing Npcap, if the
	error occurs when the driver loads. When done, save the DbgView
	output to a file and submit it in your report.
